            Sometimes you dont know how a little thing impacts others. A phone
            call might save ones life, or sharing a sutta might free his entire
            life.

            Maybe its all coincidence.
            <br /> Coincidence to be selected in Navodaya,
            <br /> coincidence to have strong brotherhood,
            <br />
            coincidence to dance together,
            <br /> coincidence to experience that cycle wala kaand.
            <br />
            there are lot of things that are all connecting now Thank you for
            being that big brother to whom I can dare to cry aloud.
            <br />
            with love‚ô•Ô∏è
